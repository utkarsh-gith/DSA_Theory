ARRAYS:
 - built in datatype
 - used to store multiple values of single data type

Advantages:
 - stores data in sequential memory locations which can be accessed easily using index.
 - elements of array can be accessed using index which makes operations like traversal amd upadation of time complexity O(1).
 - simple syntax for declaration and initialisation

Disadvantages:
 - fixed size
 - size must be known at compile time
 - removing or adding elements requires shifting of existing elements
 - insertions and deletions 

Declaration:
 - int arr[10];
 - int arr[3]={2,3,4};
 - int arr[100] = {0}; , this will initialise the whole array to 0
 - if we have to initialise to any other value: two ways
   - int arr[10]; , fill(arr,arr+10,3);
   - #include<array> , array <int,10>arr; , arr.fill(5);
 - here arr is the array with 10 memory block with arr pointing the address to the first block
 - if the array has n memory blocks, the nindex starts from 0 to n-1 
 - to access all elemnts of the array: for(int i=0;i<arr.size();i++)
 

 - When we pass an array to the function and make changes to it in the function, then the changes are
   made to the original array, not to a copy since we pass the address not the value
