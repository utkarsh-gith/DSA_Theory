ARRAYS:
 - built in datatype
 - used to store multiple values of single data type

Advantages:
 - stores data in sequential memory locations which can be accessed easily using index.
 - elements of array can be accessed using index which makes operations like traversal amd upadation of time complexity O(1).
 - simple syntax for declaration and initialisation

Disadvantages:
 - fixed size
 - size must be known at compile time
 - removing or adding elements requires shifting of existing elements
 - insertions and deletions
