LINKED LIST:
 - linear data structure containg collection of nodes
 - each node contains data and a pointer pointing the next node
 
 Advantages:
  - dynamic data structure
  - Can grow or shrink at run time, no mrmory wasted
  - no shift of elements needed at time of deletion or insertion
  - efficient for implementing other data structures like stacks, queues

 Types:
  - Singly Linked List
   - contains a data element and a ponter pointing the next node
   - class Node{
        public:
            int data;
            Node *next;  
     }; 
  - Doubly Linked List
   - contains a data element, a ponter pointing the next node and a
     pointer pointing to the previous node
   - class Node{
        public:
            int data;
            Node *next;  
            Node *prev; 
     }; 
  - Circular Linked List
   - contains a data element and a ponter pointing the next node
   - the last node points head 
   - class Node{
        public:
            int data;
            Node *next;  
     }; 
  - Circular Doubly Linked List
   - contains a data element, a ponter pointing the next node and a
     pointer pointing to the previous node
   - the last node points the head
   - class Node{
        public:
            int data;
            Node *next;  
            Node *prev; 
     };
